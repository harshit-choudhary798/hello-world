Project Title: Angular Project Showcase

1. Displaying Data and Event Handling:
   - Implemented data binding to display dynamic content on the user interface.
   - Utilized Angular's interpolation and property binding to showcase data from the component.
   - Incorporated event binding to handle user interactions such as button clicks and form submissions.

2. Building Reusable Components:
   - Structured the project using Angular components to promote reusability and modularity.
   - Created custom components that encapsulate specific functionalities and can be easily used across different parts of the application.
   - Emphasized component encapsulation to ensure separation of concerns and enhance code maintainability.

3. Directives:
   - Utilized Angular directives to manipulate the behavior and appearance of elements.
   - Employed structural directives like *ngIf and *ngFor to conditionally render elements and iterate over collections.
   - Utilized attribute directives to dynamically modify the behavior or appearance of specific elements.

4. Template-Driven Forms:
   - Implemented template-driven forms using Angular's FormsModule.
   - Created form templates with input fields, validation rules, and submission handling.
   - Utilized ngModel for two-way data binding to synchronize data between the form and component.

5. Reactive Forms:
   - Developed forms using Angular's ReactiveFormsModule.
   - Created form controls, form groups, and form arrays to manage complex form structures.
   - Implemented form validation using built-in and custom validators.
   - Utilized reactive form APIs to handle form submissions and perform dynamic form updates.

6. Consuming HTTP Requests:
   - Integrated Angular's HttpClient module to make HTTP requests to external APIs.
   - Implemented services to encapsulate HTTP logic and promote code reusability.
   - Utilized observables and subscription-based approach to handle asynchronous responses.

7. Routing and Navigation:
   - Implemented routing in the application using Angular's RouterModule.
   - Configured route definitions to navigate between different components and views.
   - Utilized route parameters and query parameters for dynamic navigation and data retrieval.
   - Implemented route guards for protecting routes based on user authentication or authorization.

By incorporating these key concepts of Angular, the project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Angular's core features and their practical implementation.


# HelloWorld

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
